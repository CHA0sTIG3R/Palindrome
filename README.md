A fun project.


An algorithm that takes in a string and checks to see if the input is a Palindrome

a palindrome is a word/phrase or sentence that that's the same backwards as it is forward like: madam, racecar and nurses run

I used 2 approach:
the first approach was more of a naive method but without it I would not have come up with the 2nd approach.
